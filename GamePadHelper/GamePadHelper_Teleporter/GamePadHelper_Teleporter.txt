## Description: |c3399FFGamePadHelper|r module that when hovering a zone on the world map, adds a new hotkey that can be pressed in order to ask BeamMeUp to teleport the player to the target zone using the best available method. This also works with Keyboard + Mouse but is mostly useful for GamePad which does not have a convenient way to utilize BeamMeUp's normal interface.
