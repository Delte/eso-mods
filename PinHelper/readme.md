# PinHelper

https://github.com/olegbl/eso-mods/tree/main/PinHelper

Splits up the "Objectives" map pin category into multiple sub-categories for different types of points of interest. Each category is then split into complete vs incomplete to allow each to have a different visibility setting. Also allows controlling compass pins for these categories via LibAddonMenu.
